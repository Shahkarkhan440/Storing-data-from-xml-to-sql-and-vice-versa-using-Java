# Storing-data-from-xml-to-sql-and-vice-versa-using-Java
This is a simple Java program that takes the some data from xml file and store that in sql database. while it also gets the data from the sql and save it back in xml file.

This is not a perfect fine well structured code but its still works , dont have time to format it properly but hope you will get it.

How to Run this Project;

1) Make sure you have netbeans installed.
2) Make sure you have downloaded all the uploaded files.
3) Now at first open you netbeans and create new project.
4) Now locate your ojdbc.jar file and put that inside libraries folder. after that right click on the libraries -->
Click on add library->choose Mysql Ojdbc Driver in the list.( you can see it from images.. a) how to add odbc b) how to add odbc picture 2.)
5) Change the first line of code according to your package name ( as in my case the name is assignment).
6) Also you can change the name of class according to your's class name. ( in my case its Run Class).
7) Now the student_info.xml should need to be in the same directory where you run the code.
8) And the last before running the program, create a database with having one table .. ( in my case database name: Check, Databse table name: student_data)
you can create table columns according to your xml. ( see the picture -> data.png).
9) you must have sql services avialable if not install XAMPP OR WAMPP.
10) Finally! Run it now.
